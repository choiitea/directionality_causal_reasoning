The purpose of the research is to examine (1) how adults reason and make decisions about causal events and (2) how and to what extent different sources of information (e.g., spatial information) in the perceptual input influences these causal decisions. The data collected will be used to evaluate and distinguish between different theoretical hypotheses and contribute to our knowledge of how humans learn about cause and effect in the world.

Who can I talk to?

If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think the research has hurt you, talk to the research team at bzinszer@swarthmore.edu. This research has been reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). You may talk to them at +1 (610) 957-6150 or irb@swarthmore.edu if your questions, concerns, or complaints are not being answered by the research team, if you cannot reach the research team or you want to talk to someone besides the research team, or if you have questions about your rights as a research subject, want to get information, or provide input about this research.

How many people will be studied?

We expect that 32 people from the college and on the Internet will participate in this research study.

What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research? 

If you agree to participate in this research, we may ask you for some basic demographic information (to ensure that we are recruiting fairly) and to complete three simple tasks in which you’ll be asked to make decisions about causal events.

What happens if I do not want to be in this research? 

You can leave the study at any time. If you are participating for course credit, instead of being in this research study, your choices may include different research studies or an alternative assignment specified by your course professor.

Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me? 

The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during other online activities. The principal risk in this study would be breach of confidentiality. A minimal risk associated with this study is possible boredom because participants are asked to rank many different learning categories.

Will being in this study help me in any way? 

We cannot promise any direct benefits to you from your taking part in this research. However, your participation helps us to examine (1) how adults reason and make decisions about causal events and (2) how and to what extent different sources of information (e.g., spatial information) in the perceptual input influences these causal decisions. Further, by participating in this research, you will gain relevant information about ideas in psychology that may relate to the course you are currently taking.

What happens to the information collected for the research? 

We work hard to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information (your name and identifying information) to the research staff, but we cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of Swarthmore College. Identifiable data are stored separately from the research data in a password-protected file on a secure computer in a locked office to minimize the risks of accidental disclosure. Your non-identifiable responses (e.g., responses on tasks) will be retained permanently and shared openly on a scientific data repository to promote transparent research practices among labs. These data are fully de-identified, meaning that nothing relating to your name or other identifiable details about you and your participation are ever included.

What else do I need to know? 

This research is being funded by Swarthmore College. The amount of the compensation is listed on the platform where our study is advertised.
