Model Data v1
Static Training - No Inverse, Weak Inverse Expectation, Split Expectation, Strong Inverse Expectation
Causal Training - causal (causal shape only trained in ShapeONE)
50 Epochs in training

Model Choice Notation
1 = SOC / Order consistent
0 = Both
2 = Chose Inverse / Order Inconsistent Construction but not Normal / SOC Consistent / Order Consistent Construction
999 = under trained? low (<0.5) activation level in both objects

111 = SOC and Order consistent response
101 = SOC, response on first order correlation, order consistent
110 = ? Not sure how to interpret 110.
100 = SOC pass, Order agnostic
